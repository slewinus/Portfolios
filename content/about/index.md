I was born on April 30, 2003, in Saint-Cloud, a suburb of Paris. At a young age, I started to be interested in cutting-edge technology and how they could revolutionize our world. Thanks to forums and documentation, I learned different programming languages such as Python, HTML/CSS and IoT. I got seriously interested in computer networks and I wanted to understand how it was possible to secure them. Quickly I started to work in this field and at my 18th birthday I created my own company.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
