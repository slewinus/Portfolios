I was born in 2003, in the west suburb of Paris. I’m interested in cutting-edge technology since my young age and this passion doesn’t stop growing since,  even more when I understood it can be a fantastic tool to revolutionize our world

Thanks to forums and documentations, I learned different programming languages such as Python, HTML/CSS and IoT. I got seriously interested in computer networks and I wanted to understand how to secure them. I’m on my way to pass the FORTINET NSE 5 certification this year.

I started to work concretely in this field at my 18th birthday when I created my own company - DAHOUSE -  which offers managed services for SMB. 
This job gives and my BTS SIO SR which I’ve done in apprenticeship, teach me every day how to be flexible and solution oriented to offer the best customer service. 
For the next years, I decided to sharpen my skills in cloud and cybersecurity by signing for a 3 years course (also in apprenticeship) in the well known EPITECH school in Paris.
Next to my studies and my job, I keep some time to take care of my body and mind. Bodybuilding, nutrition and meditation are very important for my balance and are now part of my daily routine !

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
